# Adurite Tracker

Adurite.com is a black marketplace for Roblox limiteds items, among other ingame products. However, there are many lacking features that i would love to see on their website. This tracker grabs all item information such as their Rate and Projected status, which is not provided on the main site.

Searches up items with the lowest rates on adurite.com (with projected item flags) 

items displayed are already filtered to have the lowest rate so no need to worry about duplicates

future plans to updates (might already be implemented, but i didnt update this list)

1. rap/value over time graph
2. more item information
3. Currency converter and tax calculator

### stack
Bulit with Tauri, Rust, and React.
